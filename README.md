<h1>SolusChristusG2F's Datapack Generator</h1>
<p>An open-source Python console application created to provide a quick, easy way to generate the file structure of a Minecraft datapack for any version of the game, and created as my first release-ready programming project.<p>
<h3>Instructions for use:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the project's releases by clicking "Releases," located to the top right of this file's text.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Download the .ZIP file for the latest release by clicking "Source code (zip)."</li>
  <br>
  <li>Extract the .ZIP file to your desired path.</li>
  <br>
  <li>From here, you can either run the executable file (Windows only), which will open the application in your Command Prompt, or run the .py file in your Command Prompt (Required for Mac and Linux), which requires Python 3.13.1 to be downloaded on your system. To run the executable, simply double click it in your File Explorer. To run the .py file:</li>
  <ol>
    <br>
    <li>Make sure that Python 1.13.1 is installed on your system.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Open your Command Prompt.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Navigate to the folder where the .py file is located.</li>
    <br>

    <br>
    <li>The application will run using Python's own command line.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <li>After running the application, simply follow the instructions, input your desired path, name, namespace, and version, and generate a datapack!</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to report any bugs that you find and give any feedback you feel is necessary. This is my first time writing something like this in Python, and my first time uploading to GitHub.</p>
<p>Glory to God alone!</p>
